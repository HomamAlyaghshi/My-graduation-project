      intro: `
          In the vast emptiness of space, a mystery has confounded scientists for nearly a century: the existence of dark matter. Unlike ordinary matter—the stuff that makes up stars, planets, and humans—dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light. It’s completely invisible. Yet, its gravitational effects on galaxies and cosmic structures are undeniable.
        `,
      part1: `
          The idea of dark matter first emerged in the 1930s when Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that galaxies within the Coma Cluster were moving much faster than expected. According to Newtonian physics, the visible mass wasn't enough to keep those galaxies gravitationally bound. Zwicky proposed the existence of an unseen “missing mass.”
  
          Since then, countless observations have confirmed that galaxies rotate in ways that cannot be explained by visible matter alone. The outer edges of spiral galaxies, for instance, move as quickly as the inner regions—something only possible if there’s a massive invisible halo surrounding them.
        `,
      part2: `
          Over time, theories about dark matter evolved. It’s now believed that nearly 27% of the universe’s total mass-energy composition is made of dark matter, dwarfing the mere 5% made of normal matter. But what is it made of? That question remains unanswered.
  
          Physicists have proposed several candidates. One of the most popular is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), a hypothetical particle that would interact through gravity and the weak nuclear force, but not electromagnetism—hence its invisibility. Other candidates include axions and sterile neutrinos.
        `,
      conclusion: `
          To detect dark matter, scientists have built underground detectors shielded from cosmic rays, hoping to spot a rare interaction between a dark matter particle and normal matter. So far, these experiments have not yielded definitive results.
  
          However, in recent years, astronomical surveys using space telescopes like Hubble and ESA’s Euclid mission have begun mapping dark matter by observing how its gravity bends light—a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. These “maps” reveal a cosmic web of dark matter scaffolding the structure of the universe.
  
          The study of dark matter not only helps explain how galaxies hold together, but also sheds light on the universe’s evolution and fate. If we unlock its secrets, we may uncover a deeper layer of physics that could redefine our understanding of reality itself.

      intro: `
          Take a journey to the furthest parts of the universe as astronomers uncover galaxies billions of light-years away, revealing the cosmos’ earliest moments.
        `,
      part1: `
          These distant galaxies are not only incredibly far but also incredibly faint. Observing them requires powerful telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, which can peer back in time to see the universe as it was billions of years ago.
        `,
      part2: `
          Studying these ancient galaxies helps scientists understand how galaxies form and evolve over cosmic time. The light from these galaxies carries information about their age, composition, and rate of star formation.
        `,
      conclusion: `
          As technology improves, astronomers continue pushing the boundaries of observation, bringing us closer to uncovering the origins of the universe and the processes that shaped the galaxies we see today.

      intro: `
          Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is known for its massive and long-lasting storms that rage silently in its thick atmosphere.
        `,
      part1: `
          These storms, such as the famous Great Red Spot, have intrigued scientists for centuries. They are driven by complex atmospheric dynamics and immense energy flows deep within Jupiter.
        `,
      part2: `
          Researchers study these storms using data from spacecraft like Juno, which orbits Jupiter and sends back detailed images and measurements. Understanding these storms sheds light on the behavior of gas giants in general.
        `,
      conclusion: `
          The insights gained from Jupiter’s storms help scientists learn about planetary weather systems, magnetic fields, and even the formation of our solar system’s giant planets.
